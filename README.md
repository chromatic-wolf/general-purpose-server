# general-purpose-server

This project was created for fun and to expand my knowledge of java. As of now this program doesnâ€™t serve
any particular purpose but just as a means to mess around and try out new ideas and code.

To use
Download eclipse java IDE
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2018-12/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers

Open eclipse

Instead of using "open projects from file system" select new java project.

Then select the folder general-purpose-server and click next.

Now you can use the project.
